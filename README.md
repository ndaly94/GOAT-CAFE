This project was based on the GOAT CAFE Architecture. Originally planned on being transformed from a cafe to a functional form input machine that will accept data from a user, store it, and then send it back as a PDF. This was intended to be used for wrapping production budgets in the commercial film buisness. However early on I identified that scope to be too large for the given time frame I have to submit the project. I then decided to pivot into making a "WrapShop".
